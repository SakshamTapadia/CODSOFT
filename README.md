4. **Sales Prediction using Python:**
   Create a model to predict sales trends and patterns.

   *Dataset*
   https://github.com/SakshamTapadia/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task4%20-%20DataSet.csv
   
   *Project*
   https://github.com/SakshamTapadia/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task4%20-Sales%20Prediction%20using%20Python.ipynb
   
6. **Credit Card Fraud Detection:**
   Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques.

   *Dataset*
   The Dataset I had was of 166 mb so can't Upload that here as the compressed zip file of the dataset is       also too large so giving the link of KAGGLE from where i also downloaded the dataset.
